GettingandCleaningData

The document run_Analysis works as following:

1. Reads the required files to merge the data:features.txt,activity_labels.txt, subject_train.txt, y_train.txt, X_train.txt, subject_test.txt,y_test.txt, X_test.txt

2. Creates the two different data.frames for train and test

3. Merges test and train data.frames and creates the first data.frame "data"

4. Takes "data" and creates another data.frame withi only the variables that present the mean and std data for each measurement "dataMSTD"

5. Changes the "Activity" column data from the numeric value to the descriptive variable.

6.Presents the descriptive variable names.

7. Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject "tidydata"
